ETH Algorithms Lab HS2021
=========================

My solutions of ETH ~~Olympiad in Informatics~~ Algorithms Lab HS2021. 
Problems are summarized in the table below and explained with the header comments in source files.

In such a course, code quality is not the first priority. 
You may see bad coding styles in these files, 
such as inconsistent naming, bad indentation, untidy mixture of arrays and STL containers, etc.
It's not really my coding style. 
Instead, my idea is to copy-and-paste the provided tutorial sample code whenever possible,
and I would recommend you to do the same as well.

These files are intended to provide some inspiration if you get stuck on the problems and have
spent a reasonable amount of time. You should write the code on your own.
There is absolutely no guarantee or warranty for these files. Use them at your own risk and 
make sure to follow academic integrity regulations.

Time Management
* Read all the problems. Choose the easiest one.
* Read the problem.
* Read the problem again.
* Check understanding against the provided examples.
